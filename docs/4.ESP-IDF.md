# WIFI
Default config runs wifi event handler on core 0 

# Printf
Use ESP_LOGI in task
Use ets_printf() for everything else (printf is not thread safe)

# MQTT 

## Publish
Publish can be done in any task using esp_mqtt_client_publish(client_g, window_state_topic, buff, 0, 0, 0);

## Subscribe
Subscribe can be done everywhere too but it's recommended to be done on the MQTT event handler.

Everytime a publish arrives to the client, an event with id MQTT_EVENT_DATA is triggered and we can differentiate the event by topic and process the data
